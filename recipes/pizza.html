    <p>A pizza is a popular and versatile Italian dish that consists of a round, flat crust made from dough, which is typically topped with a variety of ingredients. The crust is often thin and crispy, although thicker variations exist. Common toppings include tomato sauce, melted cheese (usually mozzarella), and a diverse range of options like pepperoni, vegetables, mushrooms, olives, and meats. Pizzas are typically baked in an oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. This dish is enjoyed by people all around the world and can be found in numerous styles and variations, reflecting regional and cultural preferences.</p>
